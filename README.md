# MissionDesign

This code is part of my final degree project
about the preliminary design of interplanetary
trajectories using gravity assisted maneuvers. 

It is a simple approach based on patched conic 
method, the lambert problem and gravity assisted 
maneuvers. 

The implemented code was completely developed
from scratch: kepler's equation solver, function 
to find orbital elements from state vector and 
viceversa, functions to find planets ephemeris, to 
solve lambert problem... 

The code returns the delta_V needed to go from 
Earth to a defined planet, using a gravity 
assisted maneuver in a intermediate body. 

For more info about the developed code, 
the thesis can also be found here.
